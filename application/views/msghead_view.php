            <p>Welcome to the Department of Computer Science and Engineering. In this department we create future computer engineers and responsible citizens. </p>
            <p>This department was the first of its kind to offer computer science/engineering education in Bangladesh. It started in 1984 when only post graduate education was offered. Then in 1986, we started undergraduate education. The first intake was only 30 students. As of this moment, the number is 120. </p>
            <p>Our students are the best of the best, and again the best of them are our faculty members. In this department, you will find teachers who are very young, as well teachers who got the opportunity to attain age and maturity. A very friendly and congenial atmosphere exists for fostering a friendly and healthy teacher-student relationship. </p>
            <p>Here, a student gets the opportunity to excel in his academic activities. This is one of the very few departments where undergraduate students publish papers in international journals. At the same time, a student wishing to achieve some recognition in extra-curricular or co-curricular activities will also find the atmosphere helpful.</p>
            <p>Have a nice stay here and please achieve the best. </p>
