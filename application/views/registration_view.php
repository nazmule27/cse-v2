        <div class="col-md-12 col-sm-12">
            <p>Any student who uses classroom or laboratory facilities or faculty time is required to register formally. Upon admission to the university each student is assigned to a student adviser with whose consent and advice the student can register for courses he intends to take during a given term.</p>
            <h4>Registration Procedure:</h4>
            <p>At the commencement of each term, each student has to perform online course registration at http://biis.buet.ac.bd in consultation with and under the guidance of his/her advisor. Details of online course registration procedure can be found here. The date and time of registration are announced in advance by the Registrar’s Office. Much counseling and advising are accomplished at this time. It is absolutely essential that all the students complete online registration before the specified deadline. Late registration is, however, permitted during the first week on payment of a late registration fee.</p>
            <h4>Pre-conditions for Registration:</h4>
            <p>
                For first year students, department-wise enrollment/admission is mandatory prior to registration. At the beginning of the first term, an orientation program is conducted for them where they are handed over with the registration package on production of the enrollment slip/proof of admission.<br>
                Any student other than freshmen having outstanding dues to the university or a hall of residence is not permitted to register. Each student must clear their dues and obtain a clearance certificate, on the production of which, he/she will be given necessary Course Registration Forms to perform course registration.<br>
                A student is allowed to register in a particular course subject to the class capacity constraints and satisfaction of pre-requisite courses. However, even if a student fails in a pre-requisite course in any term, the concerned BUGS may allow him/her to register for course which depends upon the pre-requisite course provided that his/her attendance and performance in the continuous assessment of the mentioned pre-requisite course is found to be satisfactory.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Limits on the Credit Hours to be taken:</h4>
            <p>
                A student must be enrolled for at least 15 credit hours and is allowed to take a maximum of 24 credit hours. A student must enroll for the sessional courses prescribed in a particular term within the allowable credit hour limits.<br>
                In special cases where it is not possible to allot the minimum required 15 credit hours to a student, the concerned BUGS may approve a lesser number of credit hours to suit individual requirements. Such cases are only applicable to students leading less than 15 credit hours for graduation.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Registration Deadline:</h4>
            <p>Each student must register for the courses to be taken before the commencement of each term. Late registration is permitted only during the first week of classes. Late registration after this date will not be accepted unless the student submits a written appeal to the registrar through the concerned Head of the department and can document extenuating circumstances such as medical problems from the Chief Medical Officer of the university or some other academic commitments which prohibits enrollment prior to the last date of registration.</p>
            <h4>Penalty for Late Registration:</h4>
            <p>Students who fail to register during the designated dates for registration are charged a late registration fee of Tk. 100.00 (one hundred only). This is not waived whatever the reason behind the delay in registration.</p>
            <h4>Course Add/Drop:</h4>
            <p>
                A student has some limited options to add or delete courses from the registration list. Addition of courses is allowed only within the first two weeks of a regular term and only during the first week of a short term. Dropping a course is permitted within the first four weeks of a regular term and two weeks of a short term.<br>
                Any student willing to add or drop courses has to fill up a Course Adjustment Form that is available in the Registrar’s Office. This also has to be done in consultation with and under the guidance of the student’s respective adviser. The original copy of the Course Adjustment Form has to be submitted to the Registrar’s Office, where the required number of photocopies are made for distribution to the concerned adviser, Head, Dean, Controller of Examinations and the student.<br>
                All changes must be approved by the adviser and the Head of the concerned department. The Course Adjustment Form has to be submitted after being signed by the concerned persons. The respective course teacher’s consent is also required.<br>
            </p>
            <h4>Withdrawal from a Term:</h4>
            <p>If a student is unable to complete the Term Final Examination due to serious illness or serious accident, he/she may apply to the Head of the degree awarding department for total withdrawal from the term within a week after the end of the Term Final Examination. However, he/she may choose not to withdraw any laboratory/sessional/design course if the grade obtained in such a course is ‘D’ or better. The application must be supported by a medical certificate from the Chief Medical Officer of the university. The Academic Council will take the final decision about such applications.</p>
