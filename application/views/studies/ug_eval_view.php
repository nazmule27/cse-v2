            <p>The total performance of a student in a given course is based on a scheme of continuous assessment. For theory courses this continuous assessment is made through a set of quizzes, class evaluation, class participation, homework assignment and a term final examination. The assessment in laboratory/sessional courses is made through observation of the student at work during the class, viva-voce during laboratory hours and quizzes.</p>
            <p>Each course has a certain number of credits, which describes its corresponding weights. A letter grade with a specified number of grade points is awarded for each course for which a student is registered. A studentâ€™s performance is measures both by the number of credits completed satisfactorily and by the weighted average of the grade point earned.</p>
            <p>Letter grades and corresponding grade points will be awarded in accordance to the provisions shown below.</p>
