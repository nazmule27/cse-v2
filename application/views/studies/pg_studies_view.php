            <p>The Department of Computer Science and Engineering offers the degrees of M. Engg., M. Sc. Engg. and Ph.D under the graduate program. The courses and syllabus followed by this department for the above degrees are the most modern ones like that of advanced countries as well as appropriate to the local needs. The syllabus is so designed as to contain all the necessary study materials so that a graduate can face the engineering problems readily after graduation. The teachers of the department meet periodically to review the courses and their contents; necessary changes are made to update the needs and trends from time to time.</p>
